# Retail-data---Analysis

**Introduction**

Any retail store nowadays generates a vast amount of data. Amongst that information is data related to the sales generated by the company. Depending on the amount of information available on the customer and the products sold, this data can range from very detailed to quite basic. Nonetheless, even with a couple of fields there are interesting analysis that can be generated.

In this case, we have information from a retail store that has been gathered from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Online+Retail# and contains all the transactions occurring between 01/12/2010 and 09/12/2011 for a UK-based and registered non-store online retail. In this dataset, we have an invoice number which identifies each unique cell, as well as fields like the quantities of product sold, unit price, and country of customer. Additionally, we have a customer ID field available.

The objective of this analysis will be two-fold. First, we will generate a cohort analysis of the customers in order to identify net dollar retention and user retention. Although this type of analysis is more common for SAAS companies, it is still a good exercise for understanding how to build cohort models. Additionally, we will build a basic RFM segmentation, with the objective of segmenting customers based on their purchase recency, purchase frequency, and the monetary value of their purchase. In the section below, we will explain in more detail the concepts to be analyzed.
